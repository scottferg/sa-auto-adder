SA Auto Adder

This makes a robot that will added users to all of the waves it
is currently participating in.

It will make a page that when a user visits it, they will be presented
with a captcha, a request to put some token involving their google wave
address in their profile, and a box for their user id, and a prompt for
a password.

When everything is sucessful, they get to go to their account page
which lists all of the waves the bot is participating in, and checkboxes
to let them participate in waves if they choose to.
